# demand_analytics(daily_demand(days)) 
# Interpretation:
# Mean Daily Demand: 20.266666666666666
# Standard Deviation of Daily Demand: 4.545571715661543
# 5th Percentile of Daily Demand: 14.45
# 95th Percentile of Daily Demand: 28.549999999999997

# The mean daily demand is very close to the assumed demand of lambda = 20
# Standard deviation tells us that there is variablity of 4.5 in the daily demand
# On the 5th percentile we see that the worst days will only yield 14 units and on the opposite end
# we see that on the best days it is 28,5 units.
